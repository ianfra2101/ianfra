# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I have a wealth of experience working in Cloud Transformation. Iâ€™ve worked on an extensive and varied portfolio of 
projects for multiple FTSE 100 companies and government entities, throughout which I've gained significant experience at 
every stage of the Cloud Transformation lifecycle, both from an infrastructure and application modernisation
perspective. My favourite part of this job is finding innovative and simple solutions for complex problems.
